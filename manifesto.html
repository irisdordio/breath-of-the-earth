                We have to fall in love with Earth again. The dirt - the surroundings as an organism and the ecosystem
                as her organs. She is the food we eat, where we live and even the air we breathe. Before Earth runs out
                of time, we have to give her a moment to breathe.
            </div>
            <div class="marginbottom">
                The environment is the foundation of our safety, our well-being, and belongs to each one of us. We find
                importance in addressing the weight of this in the economy. Now economically speaking - everything uses
                resources from our planet. From smartphones and laptops, computer components, email hosting, clothes,
                shoes, backpacks, the living room curtains, headphones, phone cases, sketchbooks, dining tables, pencils
                and pens, and all the things you own (or don't but, want to).
                Environmental movements grow with an emphasis on political awareness, placing capitalism, powerful
                industries, and governments as the main antagonists - but this isn't enough. A damned paper representing
                a treatise or a Climate Agreement [The Paris Agreement] won't stop industries from snapping Earth's
                resources. Also, it won't stop us from consuming exaggeratedly. Oh boy, I can't wait to get my hands on
                the iPhone 12 Pro.
            </div>
            <div class="marginbottom">
                Although we can not see we can feel it, our lungs can breathe it, and our health can decrease with it.
                We are not taking action to prevent a catastrophe - we are taking action to survive it. The
                environmental challenges we face today are entirely different from those in the past. Of course, this is
                mostly due to western society consumption extravaganza since the 50s, boosting economic expansion during
                Post-World War II.
            </div>
            <div class="marginbottom">
                Presently, Millenials were the first generation to suffer from the consequences of climate change and,
                the last one able to do anything about it - About an impalpable enemy.
                Its invisibility prevents us from seeing it. Intangible, and immaterial to the naked eye - it's enough
                to make us unaware of a global problem that kills more than 4.8 million people a year.
            </div>
            <div class="marginbottom">
                Air pollution. We breathe in, and we breathe out. Dying a little each time we inhale and exhale. Open
                your social network app and read the news or reports warning you with, fact-checking links to scientific
                studies, how air quality only gets worse. We may not fully understand what carbon dioxide or ozone is or
                not even grasp what 4.8 million dead human beings are. Our information-filled minds can only go so far,
                and this isn't enough to make regular citizens take action.
            </div>
            <div class="marginbottom">
                Air pollution poses a leading threat to us. Soon we might be dealing with a rise in heart and pulmonary
                diseases or, respiratory infections. With this, we'll be seeing more often the lucrative air farming
                businesses, soon to provide us with pure, clean and cheap oxygen - The price of breathing: how to
                capitalize on oxygen? If there are specific demands and a supplier, there's economic value in it.
            </div>
            <div class="marginbottom">
                It's so crazy and novel, what a time to still be alive. We're used to breath free (polluted) air that
                capitalizing oxygen in bottles seems like a dystopian scenery.
            </div>
            <div class="marginbottom2">
                Oxygen is a common good. Breathing clean air must become a right for every economic and social class.
                Humans, not industries, need to understand Air pollution as a threat, not as economic expansion. Such a
                problem can't be left, for the tomorrow of tomorrows.
